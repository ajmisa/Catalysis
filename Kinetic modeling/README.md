# Kinetics of a Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reaction – Part 1

This project analyzes the kinetics of a heterogeneously catalyzed gas-phase reaction involving CO₂ and H₂ using batch experimental data. The work focuses on fitting kinetic parameters, assessing model quality, and deriving a plausible reaction mechanism consistent with the experimental findings.

## Objectives

- Determine key kinetic parameters:
  - Rate prefactor (k₀)
  - Activation energy (Eₐ)
  - Reaction orders in CO₂ and H₂
- Assess the quality of the kinetic fit using residual analysis
- Propose an overall reaction mechanism with elementary steps and a rate-determining step

## Summary of Results

- Best-fit kinetic parameters (Region I: kinetically controlled):
  - Activation energy: 41.8 kJ/mol
  - Reaction order in H₂: 1.389
  - Reaction order in CO₂: 0.829
  - R² = 0.993 (excellent fit)
- Mechanistic analysis supports methanol synthesis via stepwise hydrogenation of CO₂
- Analytical derivation of rate laws matches experimental orders, confirming consistency

## Methodology

- Arrhenius plots constructed using three data-fitting procedures:
  - Full temperature range
  - Restricted range to isolate kinetically controlled regime
  - Log-transformed rate fitting for enhanced uniformity
- Residual plots used to verify model quality
- Rate expressions derived using Langmuir-Hinshelwood surface kinetics
- Reaction orders confirmed through analytical differentiation of the derived rate expression

## Reaction Mechanism

The proposed mechanism includes:
- Adsorption of CO₂ and H₂
- Sequential hydrogenation to intermediates (e.g., HCOO*, H₂COO*)
- Formation and desorption of methanol and water
- Rate-determining step: H₂COO* + H* → H₃CO* + O*

The resulting rate law accounts for partial pressures and surface coverage effects.
