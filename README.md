# Catalysis Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of academic projects focused on catalysis, developed as part of the Catalysis, Science and Technology (6CPT20) course at Eindhoven University of Technology. Each project focuses on a different aspect of catalytic reaction analysis, ranging from kinetic fitting to microkinetic modeling.

## Projects Included

### 1. Kinetics of a Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reaction (Part 1)
A kinetic analysis of an industrial catalytic reaction based on batch experimental data. The project includes model fitting, determination of reaction orders, activation energy estimation, and mechanistic validation using Langmuir-Hinshelwood theory.

### 2. Microkinetic Modeling (Part 2)
This project involves the construction of a microkinetic model based on elementary steps and includes derivation of rate expressions under quasi-equilibrium and steady-state assumptions. The effects of surface coverages, temperature, and pressure are explored.

### 3. Catalyst Design Case Study
A conceptual case study focused on selecting or designing a catalyst for a given industrial reaction. It considers factors such as activity, selectivity, stability, and practical feasibility.

## Repository Structure

Each project is contained in its own folder and includes:
- A project-specific `README.md`
- Final report in PDF format
- Supplementary scripts or data (if applicable)
