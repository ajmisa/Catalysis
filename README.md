# Catalysis Projects Repository

This repository contains academic and research-driven projects focused on **catalytic science and reaction engineering**. Each project explores a specific topic in heterogeneous catalysis, often combining experimental data with kinetic modeling or molecular-level simulations.

These projects were developed during the *Catalysis, Science and Technology (6CPT20)* course at **Eindhoven University of Technology**, and are structured to reflect best practices in kinetic analysis, microkinetic modeling, and mechanistic validation.

## Projects Included

### 1. Kinetics of a Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reaction (Part 1)
A detailed kinetic analysis of an industrial CO₂ + H₂ reaction over a solid catalyst. Focused on determining rate expressions, reaction orders, and mechanistic consistency based on experimental batch data.

- Topics: Kinetic fitting, Arrhenius plots, Langmuir-Hinshelwood modeling
- [View Project](https://ajmisa.github.io/catalysis.html#part1)

### 2. Microkinetic Modeling (Planned/Upcoming)
This project will introduce elementary reaction steps into a microkinetic model for surface-mediated catalysis. It will simulate reaction rate dependencies and explore the effect of coverage and temperature on activity.

- Topics: Elementary step modeling, quasi-equilibrium, rate-determining step analysis
- [Coming Soon](https://ajmisa.github.io/catalysis.html#microkinetics)

### 3. Catalyst Design Case Study (Planned/Upcoming)
A conceptual design project aimed at developing a catalyst for a specific industrial application. The study considers not only kinetics but also catalyst material properties and support selection.

- Topics: Catalyst screening, material properties, industrial applicability
- [Coming Soon](https://ajmisa.github.io/catalysis.html#design)

## Structure

Each project folder contains:
- A detailed `README.md` with methodology and results
- Final reports in PDF format
- Python or MATLAB scripts (if applicable)
- Experimental datasets (if available)
