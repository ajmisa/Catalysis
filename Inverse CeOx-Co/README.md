# Inverse CeOx/Co Catalysts for CO₂ Methanation

This project explores the synthesis, characterization, and performance evaluation of inverse CeOx/Co catalysts for low-temperature CO₂ methanation. Unlike conventional Co-based systems supported on CeO₂, the inverse architecture features cerium oxide dispersed onto cobalt particles. The study assesses how this configuration affects structure–performance relationships and methanation activity.

## Objective

- Synthesize Ce-Co catalysts with varying Ce:Co molar ratios (0–20% Ce)
- Compare inverse CeOx/Co catalysts to conventional Co/CeOx systems
- Investigate how catalyst structure influences CO₂ activation, CH₄ selectivity, and overall performance
- Elucidate potential reaction mechanisms using advanced characterization techniques

## Catalyst Synthesis

- Method: Flame Spray Pyrolysis (FSP)
- Precursors: Cerium acetate and cobalt acetylacetonate in a 1:1 vol% solvent mixture
- Total metal concentration: 0.15 M
- Carrier gases: CH₄ and O₂ (1.5 L/min each), with an O₂ dispersion flow of 5 L/min
- Samples denoted as xCeyCo (e.g., 20Ce80Co)

## Characterization Techniques

- **H₂-TPR**: Studied reduction profiles and Co–Ce interactions
- **CO Chemisorption**: Quantified cobalt dispersion and active surface area
- **XRD**: Assessed crystalline phases and Ce incorporation
- **XANES**: Determined Ce³⁺/Ce⁴⁺ oxidation states
- **Operando IR Spectroscopy**: Monitored reaction intermediates and pathways
- **CO₂ Methanation Testing**: Evaluated conversion, selectivity, and activation energy

## Key Findings

- Cerium enhances cobalt dispersion and modifies reduction behavior
- Increasing Ce content leads to broader and shifted TPR peaks, indicating strong Co–Ce interactions
- Operando IR shows distinct intermediate pathways (e.g., formate formation) in Ce-containing samples
- 20Ce80Co exhibited the highest CH₄ space-time yield and CO₂ conversion at 300 °C
- Activation energy decreased from 94.2 kJ/mol (0Ce100Co) to 59.0 kJ/mol (10Ce90Co)

## Conclusion

The inverse CeOx/Co architecture improves catalytic efficiency by stabilizing cobalt sites, enhancing oxygen mobility, and modifying the reaction mechanism. This structure shows promise for low-temperature CO₂ methanation and offers a viable alternative to conventional Co/CeOx systems.
